# Indonesia-Hoax-News-Analysis-LDA-LSTM-Predictive-Topic-Modeling

In this experiment, I conducted a study with the title "Integrating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modeling and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for Predictive Analysis of Indonesia Hoax News." The research aims to integrate two robust analytical methods, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modeling and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to perform predictive analysis of hoax news in Indonesia. With this approach, the research seeks to enhance the accuracy of identification and understanding of fake news issues by leveraging the strengths of both models. The dataset used in this research was obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed through the following link:
